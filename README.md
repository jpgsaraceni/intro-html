# intro-html (16-feb-21 to 19-feb-21) :hatching_chick:

Introductory activities for HTML5 practice. My first ever contact with web development!

HTML is a markup language for structuring websites. It is not a programming language, as is JavaScript.

In these first activities, I learned about basic tags in HTML.

* Part 1: First HTML page, using the `<header>` tag, containing `<meta />` and `<link />` tags, including Open Graph, cannonical and alternate links, and the `<body>` tag, containing other basic tags for text, image and tables.
* Part 2: The `<form>` tag, and a basic example of the `<math>` tag.
* Part 3: Multimedia tags.

An *HTML tag* is a word between angular brackets, like `<html>`, `<div>` or `<anything>`. An *HTML element* is made up of an opening tag, some text, and a closing tag (the same word as the opening tag with a slash before it e.g. `</anything>`). An *empty element* has no closing tag or enclosed text content, such as `<img>` or `<input>`. Empty tags may also be written with a blank space and slash before the second angular bracket e.g. `<img />`.

## Getting Started :checkered_flag:

All you need is any text editor to write your HTML pages, and a web browser to run them.

1. Write and save your code on a file with a .html extension.
2. Open the file using any web browser. Note that older web browsers may not support modern HTML resources. Check out MDN's [browser compatibility data repository](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) for more details.

### P.S. I will eventually update the READMEs of each part of this module that I started writing in Portuguese
